# Reliability Analysis of Electronic Components

This project focuses on analyzing the reliability of electronic components, specifically 45nm silicon transistors, GaN power transistors, and BGA packages. The analysis is based on experimental data and reliability models, including Weibull distributions and the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) calculations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate the failure rates of key electronic components under various operational conditions. The analysis includes:

- **Silicon 45nm Transistors**: Estimating failure rates based on operating temperature and voltage stress.
- **GaN Power Transistors**: Evaluating reliability in high-temperature and high-voltage conditions, focusing on failure mechanisms like degradation in the gate dielectric.
- **BGA Packages**: Analyzing thermal cycling effects on package reliability, with a focus on the formation of microcracks in solder joints.

## Methodology

### Reliability Theory

The reliability, \(R(t)\), is defined as the probability that a component will perform its intended function without failure over a specified period. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ R(t)=e^(-λt) \]

Where:
- \(  λ \) is the failure rate (hazard function).
- \( t \) is the operational time.

In this project, we utilize the Weibull distribution to estimate the failure rates and calculate the MTTF for each component based on experimental data.

### Data Analysis

The analysis was performed using the following steps:
1. **Weibull Distribution Fitting**: Using experimental data, a Weibull plot was created to model the failure behavior of the components.
2. **MTTF Calculations**: For each component, the MTTF was calculated to estimate the expected operational lifespan.
3. **Reliability Evaluation**: A comparison was made between the components to determine which ones have higher reliability under different conditions.

### Experimental Setup

- **Silicon Transistors**: Tested under operating temperatures of 60°C with a 1.25V bias.
- **GaN Power Transistors**: Evaluated at 60°C and 12V, considering factors like thermal degradation.
- **BGA Packages**: Subjected to thermal cycling with a temperature range of 80°C to simulate real-world conditions.

## Files

The project includes the following files:

- `project_data.xlsx`: This file contains the raw data and the results of the reliability calculations for all components. It includes Weibull distribution plots, MTTF values, and failure rate analysis for each component.
- `project_summary.pdf`: A comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, methodology, results, and conclusions. This document provides a detailed breakdown of the reliability calculations and insights into the failure mechanisms of the components tested.

## Results

- **Silicon 45nm Transistors**: Achieved a reliability of 99.91% over a 15-year operational period.
- **GaN Power Transistors**: Demonstrated a higher reliability of 99.99%, suitable for high-power applications.
- **BGA Packages**: Showed a slightly lower reliability of 99.65%, primarily due to thermal cycling-induced microcracks in solder joints.

The overall reliability for a system incorporating these components was calculated to be 99.55%, indicating that the chosen components are robust for long-term use in electronic systems.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the reliability analysis of critical electronic components using real-world data and advanced reliability models. The results provide insights into the expected performance and potential failure mechanisms of each component under specific conditions. These findings can be used to guide design decisions in high-reliability electronic systems.
