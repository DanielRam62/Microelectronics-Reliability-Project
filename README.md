# Reliability of Electronic Components Project
This project explores the reliability of various electronic components, including 45nm silicon, GaN power transistors, and BGA packages. The analysis was done based on Weibull distributions and activation energy calculations.

## Project Details
- **Silicon 45nm**: Reliability estimation based on failure rate calculations.
- **GaN Power Transistors**: Calculations under high temperature and voltage conditions.
- **BGA Package**: Analysis of thermal cycling failure mechanisms.

## Tools & Methods
- Reliability formula: \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \)
- Weibull distribution and MTTF calculations.
- Data visualization through Excel.

## Files Included
- `project_data.xlsx`: Contains experimental results and reliability calculations.
- `presentation.pdf`: Project presentation and summary of findings.
